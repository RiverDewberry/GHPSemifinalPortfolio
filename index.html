                            Two player chess with ascii based graphics. The most notable thing about this project is
                            that the entirety of the board's state (piece types, valid moves, the current player's turn,
                            ect.) is stored in a Uint8Array with a size of 65.

                            was a group project where my specific contributions were the art, some of the game logic,
                            and the color correction shader.

                            text on an html canvas that was later used for ASCII platformer.

                            game on each color channel. Due to the fact that the method for displaying the text is the
                            one mentioned above, each character is not actually being drawn separately to each color
                            channel, but rather, this effect is being emulated.

                            and more game mechanics. This project draws text to the canvas pixel by pixel allowing each
                            character to be drawn one color channel at a time.
